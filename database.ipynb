       "        <td>i&#x27;m not saying pei wei is the best asian food i&#x27;ve ever tasted, far from it, it&#x27;s a fairly large chain that puts on the appearance of something more refined, it&#x27;s essentially to asian food what olive garden is to italian food.<br><br>with that said i&#x27;ve always had pretty good experiences with pei wei, the food although not spectacular is better than some of the overcooked chicken drowning in msg offered by some of the local chinese restaurants.  the portions are good sized, the food is generally consistent, and the prices are really reasonable considering this is a corporate chain in some cases cheaper than the local establishments. or dare i say it&#x27;s name &quot;panda express&quot; (which is overpriced crap)<br><br>the time before last that i went they forgot the tomato&#x27;s and the dressing for an asian chopped chicken salad that my wife ordered, i didn&#x27;t discover that the dressing was missing until i got home, i immediately called the restaurant and was speaking to a manager within 30 seconds. the manager apologized and asked me if i would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. i decided to go back to the restaurant, when i got the restaurant i told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me, the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag, and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had, and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: i need to use)<br><br>i must say i was impressed with this manager, and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially &quot;un-f$@k&#x27;s&quot; your food and returns it to you.<br><br>overall great customer service, consistent food, and a good option for takeout in surprise.</td>\n",

(huge success!)<br><br>the decor is the best part of hsw. the restaurant is appears to be a bit rundown, ostensibly dirty, and some of the windows are adorned with iron bars/mesh for safety purposes. while this may seem to be a negative, it is not. these details, coupled with the ambiance of the restaurant&#x27;s neighborhood, offer the adventurous and hungry an authentic city of cleveland dining experience.<br><br>grade: a</td>\n",

(i didn&#x27;t know this but i will explain later). on top of that, it looks like the window covering the menu and prices has not been cleaned since 2012. i ordered the polish boy combo and small size fried okra.  i had a couple in front of me and waited approximately 5 minutes before i arrived at the window ( i made a mental note changing radio stations because when i arrived at the window it took longer than the entire song of baltimora &#x27;tarzan boy&#x27; as i kept changing stations to pass times and ended back on the 80&#x27;s channel to hear the end of that song and start a new one).  do not think of this place as a typical &#x27;fast food&#x27; drive thru.  you order and you will wait but they don&#x27;t tell you that which can be a good thing.  this can give you the impression that the food is fresh but to tell you the truth, it didn&#x27;t seem like it was &#x27;fresh&#x27; in least bit.  in fact, it appeared that they took care of of whoever was inside before the drive thru customers because i actually watched 3 polish boys being made while i waited for my single polish boy because i guess the people inside took priority and they had only one person making food with 3 other people handling money and passing out beverages.  while watching someone else&#x27;s food being prepared another employee came to the window and gave me my ridiculous total of $11.98!!  i gave her my money and at first i just simply thought the tax was high so i asked why my total was $11.98?  apparently the prices listed on their dusty and dirty outside menu board are wrong!  the rude employee didn&#x27;t tell me anything.  she just &quot;handed&quot; me a receipt.  instead of the okra being $2.75 it was $3.99!  i told the lady this and she just said, &quot;it is?  i will have to change that.&quot;  she walked away and i never saw her again. well, what about you overcharging??  i was already upset waiting for food so i turned my car off to save gas until i arrived at the window. i was overcharged and the lady avoiding me now, had another employee hand me my beverage. coke in a can. as i was saying my food was over charged, she closed the window!! what!! this is how you deal with customers with issues!?!? you avoid them! <br>     finally i received my food.  they had another employee hand me the food and this worker was a male.  i was actually able to talk with him and say that i was overcharged. he was not helpful or even courteous in any way! he said, &quot;i can&#x27;t help you, i don&#x27;t work with the menu.&quot; i kept telling him, this was wrong, you can&#x27;t overcharge customers and you can&#x27;t treat people like this! again, like a robot, &quot;i can&#x27;t help you with that.&quot;  i heard enough. &quot;if you can&#x27;t fix this or help and none of you are willing to help without me making a scene then i&#x27;m done with all of you!&quot; he replied again, &quot;i can&#x27;t help you&quot; and shut the window then walked away while all the other employees avoided the window. <br>     i&#x27;m never returning to this establishment!! what happened?? the employees don&#x27;t care! a year ago this was a decent place! they even have photos of robin williams (i miss him so much!) visiting there with his family.  what happened? i don&#x27;t know and i wish i could give this place more stars but this whole experience was enough for me to give them the lowest rating. i had a few good times here in the past with some memorable moments but it will always be overlooked by this horrible treatment! there is no excuse for this treatment and attitude! even the food changed in my opinion. my polish boy was a regular sized hot dog with fries and coleslaw slapped on top of it and my fried okra was soggy.  worst of the all, the sauce was different this time too. it was watered down and tasted old if that&#x27;s possible. i will not return.</td>\n",

       "        <td>retro dog is a cool place to stop if you are out in the cuyahoga valley or at blossom and feel like a snack or some ice cream.  kind of separate from anything else, you will see a large take out with parking out front where you can have the food brought out to your car or go in to the cool dining area.  the decor is bright and in your face in a good way, kind of a very modern expression of a 50&#x27;s diner.  the menu consists of hot dogs, sandwiches, sides and plenty of ice cream based desserts.  <br><br>i have had the veggie retro dog, the fries, onion rings and a couple of milk shakes, overall the food is good, not great.  the veggie retro dog is a pretty nice veggie hot dog with veggie coney sauce, mustard and onions on a wheat bun.  the mild hot dog has a nice snap but it could have used more of the toppings, especially the coney sauce, which is a mild veggie chili.  the french fries are fresh cut, but were not terribly crisp.  the onion rings missed the mark with the fried batter overpowering the flavor of the onions and they seemed a bit overcooked.<br><br>the 2 milkshakes i tried were the best items i had at retrodog; prepared fresh with soft serve ice cream.  the flavor selection is extensive and they have some unique flavors for you to try.  the chocolate banana was a nice balance of the banana milk shake with hot fudge; the salted caramel was a nice balance of sweet with a hint of salt.  overall good shakes, especially using soft serve ice cream as the base.<br><br>retro dog is probably not worth a special trip or the place for a full meal, but if you are in the area and need a snack it is worth a try.</td>\n",

       "        <td>i am from the east and have eaten white castles for a long time.  i love them and couldn&#x27;t wait for them to get here i went the opening day.  i was not happy with the price.  they should be ashamed for charging people so much.  i brought them the first day and will not come back.  $8.99 for 4-cheeseburgers, fires, and soda are you people crazy.  my 11 yr old grand daughter can eat that and more because the burgers are so small. .i paid $15 plus some change for that combo plus 4-burgers.  that was my usual order after the club in chicago and minneapolis.  it  cost me $6 plus some change for the same order the last time i had them in minneapolis.  i have not lived here that long so i have recently had white castles.  just because it is on the strip that should not make such a big difference.  that is just pure greed!!!  if they open a store off the strip and the prices are within reason i would patronize that store but not on the strip ever again.  it is so sad that companies are so greedy, you people make enough profits give us a break.  this is why i am only giving one star and i hope others follow suit.</td>\n",

       "        <td>i had my first experience with the white castle (wc) food truck at the great american foodie fest held in san diego. i always heard of the business--known for their sliders--and was always interested in tasting one of their products. i guess i just assumed that wc was like the mcdonald&#x27;s of the east coast, and i wanted to see what it was about those sliders that made them so great (especially after seeing the white castle excerpt from &quot;harold and kumar&quot;).<br> <br>there were pre-organized queues and a huge wc tent, so i&#x27;m sure the vendor expected mile-long lines. however, when we went on the first night the foodie fair was open, there was no line; only a few people were in front of us so we didn&#x27;t have to wait long to order and get our grub.<br> <br>final verdict: after all that hype, i think i was slightly underwhelmed by those sliders. maybe it&#x27;s just because i was different from what i was expecting. was i glad i tried them? yes, definitely. would i crave them late at night? not so much ... if i were craving fast food late at night, i would probably go for five guys fries (soooo addictive) or anything from del taco or chick-fil-a.<br> <br>but here&#x27;s what my friend and i got, as well as what i would try next time if i ever visited a wc again:<br> <br>&quot;cheese sliders&quot;: these sliders vary slightly from the &quot;original&quot; because they include a slide of american cheese. i need cheese in my burgers ... since i take out the tomatoes and pickles, i can&#x27;t really just have a slider with the burger alone. my friend and i got 2 for $3 (at least these buggers were cheap), and we saw them being mass produced--in that the thin patties were on the grill in multiples and the workers were putting everything together in true assembly-line fashion. the bun was soft and tasted fresh, which was a plus, but the patty--is that what you even call it?--was super thin ... so thin that i could hardly even taste it. it reminded me of a super thin slice of spam. i liked the fact that the slider was really light--didn&#x27;t feel heavy and bloated after eating it--but it definitely needed that cheese. i guess i was expecting the slider to be addicting/have some kind of addictive taste since it got so much hype, but that factor was lacking for me. i&#x27;m glad for the experience, but i would probably order something different next time. (seriously, i don&#x27;t know how people order packs and packs of these).<br> <br>&quot;bacon &amp; cheddar grilled chicken&quot;: i would actually be interested in trying this slider because it has more elements that i like. this medley features savory grilled chicken with a zesty cheddar-cheese sauce and smoky-bacon crumbles. i do like cheese and bacon, so maybe this slider will be slightly more tasty that the &quot;cheese slider&quot; that i had.<br> <br>&quot;western bbq grilled chicken&quot;: i love bbq flavors so this slider sounds like it&#x27;s right up my alley. it features a savory, grilled chicken slider topped with smoky bbq sauce and crispy onion rings. i do like bbq-inspired sandwiches, so i&#x27;m down to try this slider one day.<br> <br>&quot;fish sliders&quot;: i&#x27;ve had fish sliders before that i really liked, so i&#x27;m willing to give the wc version a go. it features two fish sliders made with alaska pollock and topped with american cheese. you can even upgrade to a combo and add small fries and a soft drink. i&#x27;m not the hugest fan of soft drinks, but i would want to add fries to my order ... this is sort of like fish &#x27;n chips, after all, but in slider form.<br> <br>&quot;loaded fries&quot;: i&#x27;m a huge fan of loaded fries, and since the wc version features fries topped with creamy ranch dressing and hickory-smoked bacon crumbles, i&#x27;d definitely want to order them some day.<br> <br>&quot;brownie on a stick&quot;: this dessert sounds really cute and seems to be a great mini indulgence. this treat on a stick features a chocolate brownie dipped in a rich, fudge coating. brownies are one of my favorite snacks, and everything just tastes better when it&#x27;s presented in a fun form ... so if i&#x27;m craving something sweet after my wc meal, i would go for this.<br> <br>&quot;cheesecake on a stick&quot;: like its brownie counterpart, this cheesecake piece is bound to be the best little indulgence after a fast food meal. it&#x27;s made with light and creamy cheesecake and dipped in a rich, fudge coating. i&#x27;m so down to try this chocolate covered cheesecake (both of these dipped dessert options were not available at the truck, so maybe i have to visit an actual wc restaurant to get it ...)<br> <br>&quot;bacon, egg &amp; cheese slider&quot;: this breakfast slider sounds like one of the best ones on the wc menu. it includes freshly cracked, loosely scrambled eggs topped with american cheese and crisp, hickory-smoked bacon on a steamed signature bun. i&#x27;m a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches, so i would be willing to try this breakfast slider if i came to wc when the breakfast menu&#x27;s being featured.</td>\n",

(not that i condone eating big macs)<br>we ordered the meal that came with 4 sliders (with cheese) and some fries, and also ordered 2 of their chicken ring sliders. the chicken ones were actually pretty tasty, tasted very similar to burger kings chicken sandwiches, the sort of over processed ground chicken variety. the sliders were fairly tasty and i did like the idea of eating the little thing, and though they are very basic they taste pretty good, as everything cooks in and with their caramelized onions. i did, however, need to dip the burger in ketchup to get a more deep flavor. i felt like they tasted sort of like a basic mcdonald&#x27;s cheeseburger and an in-n-out &quot;animal style&quot; cheeseburger had a baby (so somewhere i between the quality of the 2 though much more on the mcdonald&#x27;s side).<br>the fries were also pretty good, though nothing to write home about. they are the wavy variety and not over salted. <br>because the things were so small, i had the go back and order more food! this time i got 2 more chicken ring sliders and went for 2 double cheese sliders this time, which by the way are over $3 a piece! that&#x27;s like the price of the &quot;six dollar burger&quot; at carl&#x27;s jr, or the more expensive burgers at about every fast food chain, but again even the double burger is less substantial than a single &quot;$.99 cent menu&quot; burger elsewhere. <br>all in all we ended up spending over $30!!! just to get full here, that is a ton for a fast food place!<br>i really don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be back to a white castle anytime soon, it&#x27;s possible the craving could hit me when i see one because it is a unique taste, but even then, i&#x27;ll likely just grab one slider to go and eat it on the way to wherever else i&#x27;m going to eat.</td>\n",

       "        <td>for over 30 years i&#x27;ve been hearing about white castle sliders from those that lived in, or traveled to parts of the country that offered them. then, after harold and kumar made their movie, i truly hoped that one day i would travel to a place in the mid west or eastern parts that had a white castle burger joint, or even better, i wished that white castle would open a store here in southern california. sadly, no luck either way. then voila! i saw them in the frozen section of my local super market. i bought a pack, took them home and immediately nuked a few in the microwave. not bad i thought to myself. they had a unique flavor with kind of an onion tang. nevertheless, these were frozen burgers. i knew the freshly made ones had to be better, so i withheld final judgement, and continued to hope for a real experience at a white castle location.<br><br>fast forward several years and i&#x27;m walking the strip in las vegas and the white castle sign hit my like a ton of bricks! there it  was! boom! a real deal white castle burger joint right here in las vegas, and right in front of me! i dragged the wife into the place and immediately placed an order for sliders, fries and a drink. so let me get this out of the way first, i don&#x27;t like krinkle fries. and, the white castle krinkle fries were no different than any other krinkle fries i&#x27;ve tried. so what did i think of the sliders? they were really tasty and much better than the frozen ones, as i expected them to be. these are truly unique sliders. they are steamed with the onion on the patties. i think that&#x27;s part of what makes them distinctive.<br><br>now, if i&#x27;m only judging the slider, in the context of the fast food world of large or popular burger chains, i give it 5 stars considering the under $2 price. i don&#x27;t smoke weed, but if i did, i could see myself eating a bag of these little morsels after smoking a bowl, just like harold and kumar did in the movie. <br><br>the slider is the only thing that stood out. again, i didn&#x27;t care for the fries, and everything else was just okay. service was decent, drink fountain was nothing special. over all, 4 stars for white castle, mostly because of their famous sliders.</td>\n",

       "        <td>this probably deserves a 4-star rating given most people&#x27;s expectations, so let me clarify before i get into the review: i have no real qualms about this place besides the price. the burgers are nearly as good as those in the midwest.<br><br>so, the good:<br><br>- burgers are nearly as good as the midwest<br>- they give you as many ketchup packets as you want (you probably need to ask if you want any at all)<br>- the place seemed clean enough during a busy night around 1 in the morning<br>- the wait wasn&#x27;t bad, for the ordering line or for the pickup line<br><br>the bad:<br><br>- the main thing is the price. it shouldn&#x27;t be more than a dollar per burger, and obviously buying more burgers should give you some sort of deal. but it&#x27;s (as of april 2016) $35.99 for a crave case (30 plain sliders), which is almost the exact same price as 30 individual sliders. likewise, it costs 30 cents to add cheese to a slider. if you add cheese to all 30 sliders, you might expect some deal. nope. 30 cents times 30 slices of cheese is 9 dollars, which is the exact amount you&#x27;ll have to add to your price if you want 30 sliders with cheese instead of regular sliders. that means you&#x27;re paying $44.99 for 30 tiny sliders...and that&#x27;s before taxes.<br><br>look, i know it&#x27;s the vegas strip, so i don&#x27;t really mind the price that much. everything&#x27;s more expensive, and the constant stream of customers proves they&#x27;re asking a fair market price. still, i&#x27;m taking away a star because that&#x27;s just way too much money for those tiny burgers. it costs the same amount for 30 tiny sliders as for like 30 full size mcdoubles.<br><br>- the burgers aren&#x27;t quite as good as in the midwest. they&#x27;re still good -- they&#x27;ll satisfy if you&#x27;re a white castle fan like myself -- but they&#x27;re just slightly lacking. i think the problem is that they use this large island grill where something like 4 people work at once, and that open setup results in the steam escaping. for those who don&#x27;t know, part of the magic of white castle is that the burgers are cooked by steaming them over a bed of onions. so that onion flavor permeates the entire burger and bun. but with the vegas location setup, i think the steam doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job. which also results in less moist buns.<br><br>but don&#x27;t let this sway you from going here. still very good.<br><br>- the staff wasn&#x27;t all that friendly. not that they were rude. when i asked for ketchup, the guy gave me plenty of ketchup, but didn&#x27;t even look at me as he was serving me. the people on the grill looked a bit miserable. that&#x27;s understandable, given they probably spend their day making millions of sliders non-stop because this is a hugely busy location. the girl taking orders was neither friendly nor unfriendly.<br><br>- the menu is a bit poorly done. the cheese options, for instance, are listed as a footnote at the top (are those still called footnotes?) where it mentions that you can add cheese or jalapeno cheese. for those unfamiliar with the white castle menu, they&#x27;ll probably just miss that option entirely.<br><br>- it&#x27;s way at the end of the strip (that is, the part furthest from the 15 freeway). not as far as trump hotel, but past the venetian. so if you&#x27;re down near excalibur, or even the cosmopolitan, you&#x27;ve got a long walk ahead of you. might be better to drive to closer hotel and walk. harrah&#x27;s parking is free and easy to access off the strip (not sure about other hotels -- do your own research).<br><br>summary:<br><br>go here. it&#x27;s good.<br><br>so why the low rating? i&#x27;m taking off two stars because of 1) price and 2) not having the service or taste that lives up to the midwest experience. but it&#x27;s still quite good -- i just can&#x27;t justify mathematically giving it 5 stars because 5 stars would be the standard white castle experience, which this misses. but going here was still awesome.<br><br>pro tip: white castles are excellent breakfast food. let them sit overnight -- keep the burger cases overlapping to trap the moisture in! -- then let them sit out overnight and enjoy the next day.<br><br>always consume with ketchup.<br><br>helpful info for the uninitiated:<br><br>white castle sliders are tiny and come standard with chopped, slightly grilled onion, and a pickle. no mustard or ketchup. you have to ask for ketchup packets if you want, but it&#x27;s easier to bring your own bottle so you don&#x27;t spend your meal opening and squeezing out 30 packets.<br><br>for guys with a young appetite, you could easily consume 10 sliders. something like 6 might be enough for you.<br><br>women and girls with lesser appetites might be satisfied with 2-4 sliders.<br><br>don&#x27;t forget to try out their other stuff, like jalapeno cheese, onion rings, etc. it&#x27;s all good stuff.</td>\n",
