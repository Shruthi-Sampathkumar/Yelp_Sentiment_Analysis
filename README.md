## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/zzhang83/Demo/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# Project Introduction:
It is a classic idea to run a restaurant. If you are a real foodie, this is certainly some good reasons in terms of running a restaurant. If you enjoy cooking a lot, you might think you can open your own restaurant.If you are after some sort of business to invest in and something to fill your time, running a restaurant might seem like a good idea to you. However, opening a restaurant might be easy, keeping it going is the most difficult part. It’s important to understand all the various jobs that are involved in running a restaurant before you actually open one. For example, you need to decide where you want to open you business, what kind of customers you are targeting at, who is your competitor in the neighbourhood and you might also want to know if most of the households in your neighbourhood can afford your food.etc.

In this project, we are goint to use Yelp open dataset to help us determine essential factors for private businessmen opening up new restaurants such as customers’ preferences/demand, customers’ income/racial information, and seasonality in different regions in the U.S.

At the end of our project, we expect to achieve the followings:
1. Mapping restaurants’ geolocations with people’s income level, racial, and other information at that region to estimate the size of the potential market and people’s preference. 
2. Analyzing people’s reviews and their ratings to determine factors that competitors have an advantages of or disadvantages of. 
3. Based on the timestamp of customers’ reviews and their ratings to determine changes in people’s preference due to seasonality (spring/summer/fall/winter)
